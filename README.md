# Windows Live Messenger Clone
This project is a clone of the classic Windows Live Messenger, built using React.js and Vite. 
The application includes the login page, contact list, chat page, and other essential features, although it is not fully functional yet.
I'm starting with the visual part, trying to get as close as possible to the original version, although sometimes I am not able to find the same icons or recreate certain parts in CSS.
