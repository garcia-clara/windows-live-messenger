## About

**MSN Messenger**, later rebranded as **Windows Live Messenger**, was a cross-platform instant messaging client developed by Microsoft. It was first released in 1999 and discontinued in 2013.  

This project aims to visually recreate the beloved application of our childhood. It was built as a learning experience and as a tribute to nostalgic users like me. I had so much fun coding it, researching, and recovering original assets to make it as authentic as possible.  

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did creating it! ðŸ˜Š  

The initial idea was to add "fake" contacts (AI bots) to replicate the MSN experience. For now, I donâ€™t have the time or motivation to develop a real chat applicationâ€”but who knows, maybe in the future!  

As a junior developer, I kindly ask for your understanding if the application has bugs or missing features. Iâ€™m aware itâ€™s not perfect, and I do my best to fix issues as they come up.
