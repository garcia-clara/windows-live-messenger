# [Windows Live Messenger](https://wlm.vercel.app/)

https://wlm.vercel.app/

Application that I recreated for fun! I tried to visually replicate the original 2009 application as closely as possible.

It is not 100% functional, for example, it is not possible to add contacts or truly exchange messages with someone.

There is no backend, hence no database. For this purpose, there is <a href="https://escargot.chat/">Escargot</a>, which inspired me to recreate the interface. 
The goal here is purely to evoke nostalgia through visuals and sounds.

I also recreated the app to learn more about React JS, so my code may not be very clear, clean, and could be inconsistent.

Since I'm not an expert, please be understanding if the application has bugs.
